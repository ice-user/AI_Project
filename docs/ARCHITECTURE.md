Dependencies only point **down** this diagram. The engine imports nothing from the project, bots
import only the engine, and so on. If you find yourself importing upward, ask in the chat first.

## The contracts

These four interfaces are what lets five people work at the same time. They are **frozen**: any
change to them needs a PR labelled `contract` and approved by the whole team.

### 1. Engine: `dnb/engine/state.py`

- A move is an **int edge index**. Horizontal edges come first, then vertical edges (formula in
  the module docstring). `edge_coords()` converts an index to `("h"|"v", r, c)`.
- `GameState` is **immutable**: `state.apply(move)` returns a new state. That makes search and
  simulation safe, since nothing has to be undone.
- `GameState.new(rows, cols)`, `.legal_moves()`, `.apply(m)`, `.is_over()`, `.winner()`,
  `.current_player`, `.scores`, `.owners`, `.sides(box)`, `.boxes_completed_by(m)`.
- **Extra-turn rule:** `current_player` stays the same after a move that completes a box. Never
  assume players alternate.

Person 1 may make the internals faster at any time (bitboards, caching) as long as these
signatures and the tests stay the same.

### 2. Bot: `dnb/bots/base.py`

```python
class Bot:
    def evaluate_moves(self, state) -> dict[int, float]: ...  # score every legal move
    def choose_move(self, state) -> MoveResult: ...  # MoveResult(move, score, info)
```

Scores are always in **[-1, 1], from the point of view of the player to move**. That way the
review (Person 4) and difficulty (Person 3) can compare any two bots.

### 3. Registry: `dnb/bots/registry.py`

Bots are created from text specs: `"random"`, `"greedy:randomness=0.3"`, `"minimax:depth=4"`,
`"montecarlo:sims=2000,greedy_playouts=true"`. A difficulty level is just a spec
(`dnb/difficulty/levels.py`), and the arena, server and hints all use the same specs.

### 4. API and database: `dnb/server/schemas.py`, `dnb/server/db.py`, `web/src/api.ts`

| Method | Path | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET  | `/api/bots` | P5 | working |
| POST | `/api/games` | P5 | working |
| GET  | `/api/games/{id}` | P5 | working |
| POST | `/api/games/{id}/move` | P5 | working (bot replies, including extra turns) |
| GET  | `/api/games/{id}/hint` | P4 + P5 | 501 stub |
| GET  | `/api/games/{id}/review` | P4 + P5 | 501 stub |
| GET  | `/api/players/{id}/stats` | P3 + P5 | to add |

`schemas.py` and `web/src/api.ts` must change in the **same PR**. Finished games go to the SQLite
`games` table (schema in `db.py`). Persons 3 and 4 read from it.

## Board sizes

The default is 3×3 boxes (24 edges). Minimax at full depth is only practical on small boards.
Bots must work on any size from 1×1 to 7×7, and difficulty levels may also change the board size.

## LLM explanations

`dnb/coach/explain.py` has an `LLMProvider` interface with `MockProvider` (used by tests and CI)
and `GeminiProvider` (used when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`). The prompt only gets
**facts computed by the review** (which move, which better move, how many boxes it gave away), so
the LLM rephrases what happened rather than analysing the game itself.
